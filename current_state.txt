    backend>function>general>process_matches


        I figured out how to get the keys for classes, maybe use them in a function
        to create queries in insert or update

        get champpool season based

        fix problem with matchhistory check/filter


to do:
    get insert or update ready for extra matchdata

    get db matchcheck ready

    test database

    later, add gsheet function to get gsheet graphs if wanted 

    api to comunicate with database

    frontend

    found an issue:
         ..psql [line281], only uploads rank games, need to check in playerstats, not in matches
         for filtered_matchhistory



    _________________________

    MUST DO!!
    Remove ARAM_MATCH, ARENA_MATCH and save all in
    MATCH (PSQL TABLE) 

    REMOVE PLAYERSTATS for not summonersrift games!

    TOURNAMENTCODE might be a problem, find 
    workaround
    --> Tournamentcode and other stuff that 
    necessery "Nullable=True"

    look into team early surrender!!!

    added early ff in match table --> NVM early ff is not accurate, always false, check why
    -> filter matches if early ff or not
    --> use only not ff'ed games for champpool

    to_process = 
{
	puuid = 
		[ 
			{season1 = 
				[[matchdata1, opponentdata1], [matchdata2, opponentdata2], ...],
			season2 =
				[[matchdata1, opponentdata1], [matchdata2, opponentdata2], ...],
