currently:
    backend>function>general>process_matches


        I figured out how to get the keys for classes, maybe use them in a function
        to create queries in insert or update

        get champpool season based

        fix problem with matchhistory check/filter


to do:
    get insert or update ready for extra matchdata

    get db matchcheck ready

    test database

    later, add gsheet function to get gsheet graphs if wanted 

    api to comunicate with database
